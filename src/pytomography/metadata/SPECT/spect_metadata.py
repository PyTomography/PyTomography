class SPECTPSFMeta():
    r"""Metadata for PSF correction. PSF blurring is implemented using Gaussian blurring with :math:`\sigma(r) = f(r,p)` where :math:`r` is the distance from the detector, :math:`\sigma` is the width of the Gaussian blurring at that location, and :math:`f(r,p)` is the ``sigma_fit`` function which takes in additional parameters :math:`p` called ``sigma_fit_params``. (By default, ``sigma_fit`` is a linear curve). As such, :math:`\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-r^2/(2\sigma(r)^2)}` is the point spread function. Blurring is implemented using convolutions with a specified kernel size. 

     Args:
        sigma_fit_params (float): Parameters to the sigma fit function
        sigma_fit (function): Function used to model blurring as a function of radial distance. Defaults to a 2 parameter linear model.
        kernel_dimensions (str): If '1D', blurring is done seperately in each axial plane (so only a 1 dimensional convolution is used). If '2D', blurring is mixed between axial planes (so a 2D convolution is used). Defaults to '2D'.
        min_sigmas (float, optional): This is the number of sigmas to consider in PSF correction. PSF are modelled by Gaussian functions whose extension is infinite, so we need to crop the Gaussian when computing this operation numerically. Note that the blurring width is depth dependent, but the kernel size used for PSF blurring is constant. As such, this parameter is used to fix the kernel size such that all locations have at least ``min_sigmas`` of a kernel size.
