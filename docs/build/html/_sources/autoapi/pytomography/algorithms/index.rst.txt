   Bases: :py:obj:`StatisticalIterative`

   Implementation of the block-sequential-regularized (BSREM) reconstruction algorithm: :math:`\hat{f}^{n,m+1} = \hat{f}^{n,m} + \alpha_n D \left[H_m^T \left(\frac{g_m}{H_m \hat{f}^{n,m} + s} -1 \right) - \beta \nabla_{f^{n,m}} V \right]`. The implementation of this algorithm corresponds to Modified BSREM-II with :math:`U=\infty`, :math:`t=0`, and :math:`\epsilon=0` (see https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1207396). There is one difference in this implementation: rather than using FBP to get an initial estimate (as is done in the paper), a single iteration of OSEM is used; this initialization is required here due to the requirement for global scaling (see discussion on page 620 of paper).

   :param projections: projection data :math:`g` to be reconstructed.
   :type projections: torch.Tensor
   :param system_matrix: System matrix :math:`H` used in :math:`g=Hf`.

If ``subdep_norm`` (sub-iteration dependent + normalized) then :math:`D = \left(H_m^T 1\right)^{-1}`. See section III.D in the paper above for a discussion on this.
   :type scaling_matrix_type: str, optional
   :param device: The device correpsonding to the tensors output by the system matrix. In some cases, although the system matrix implementation uses ``pytomography.device`` in its internal computation, it will output tensors on the CPU due to their size (such as in listmode PET). Defaults to ``pytomography.device``.

      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: __call__(n_iters, n_subsets, n_subset_specific = None, callback = None)

      Performs the reconstruction using ``n_iters`` iterations and ``n_subsets`` subsets.

      :param n_iters: Number of iterations
      :type n_iters: int
      :param n_subsets: Number of subsets
      :type n_subsets: int
      :param n_subset_specific: Iterate only over the subset specified. Defaults to None
      :type n_subset_specific: int

   :param scatter: estimate of scatter contribution :math:`s`.
   :type scatter: torch.Tensor

   .. py:method:: _compute_callback(n_iter)

      Computes callback for KEM transform; this is reimplemented here because the `self.object_prediction` corresponds to the :math:`\alpha` value and not :math:`f`. As such, the `KEMTransform` needs to be applied before the object is input to the callback.

This reconstruction technique requires an instance of a user-defined ``prior_network`` that implements two functions: (i) a ``fit`` method that takes in an ``object`` (:math:`x`) which the network ``f(z;\theta)`` is subsequently fit to, and (ii) a ``predict`` function that returns the current network prediction :math:`f(z;\theta)`. For more details, see the Deep Image Prior tutorial.

   Implementation of filtered back projection reconstruction :math:`\hat{f} = \frac{\pi}{N_{\text{proj}}} \mathcal{R}^{-1}\mathcal{F}^{-1}\Pi\mathcal{F} g` where :math:`N_{\text{proj}}` is the number of projections, :math:`\mathcal{R}` is the 3D radon transform, :math:`\mathcal{F}` is the 2D Fourier transform (applied to each projection seperately), and :math:`\Pi` is the filter applied in Fourier space, which is by default the ramp filter.

   :param projections: projection data :math:`g` to be reconstructed
   :type projections: torch.Tensor
   :param angles: Angles corresponding to each projection
   :type angles: Sequence
   :param filter: Additional Fourier space filter (applied after Ramp Filter) used during reconstruction.
