:py:mod:`pytomography.projections`
==================================

.. py:module:: pytomography.projections

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   This module contains classes/functionality for operators that map between distinct vector spaces. One (very important) operator of this form is the system matrix :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}`, which maps from object space :math:`\mathbb{U}` to image space :math:`\mathbb{V}`

.. py:class:: SystemMatrix(obj2obj_transforms, im2im_transforms, object_meta, image_meta, n_parallel=15)

   The system matrix :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}` simulates an imaging system; it takes in an object :math:`f \in \mathbb{U}` and maps it to a corresponding image :math:`g \in \mathbb{V}` that would be produced by the imaging system. A system matrix consists of sequences of object-to-object and image-to-image transforms that model various characteristics of the imaging system, such as attenuation and blurring. While the class implements the operator :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}` through the ``forward`` method, it also implements :math:`H^T:\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{U}` through the `backward` method, required during iterative reconstruction algorithms such as OSEM.

   :param obj2obj_transforms: Sequence of object mappings that occur before forward projection.
   :type obj2obj_transforms: Sequence[Transform]
   :param im2im_transforms: Sequence of image mappings that occur after forward projection.
   :type im2im_transforms: Sequence[Transform]
   :param object_meta: Object metadata.
   :type object_meta: ObjectMeta
   :param image_meta: Image metadata.
   :type image_meta: ImageMeta

   .. py:method:: initialize_transforms()

      Initializes all transforms used to build the system matrix



   .. py:method:: forward(object, angle_subset = None)

      Implements forward projection :math:`Hf` on an object :math:`f`.

      :param object: The object to be forward projected
      :type object: torch.tensor[batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz]
      :param angle_subset: Only uses a subset of angles (i.e. only certain values of :math:`j` in formula above) when back projecting. Useful for ordered-subset reconstructions. Defaults to None, which assumes all angles are used.
      :type angle_subset: list, optional

      :returns: Forward projected image where Ltheta is specified by `self.image_meta` and `angle_subset`.
      :rtype: torch.tensor[batch_size, Ltheta, Lx, Lz]


   .. py:method:: backward(image, angle_subset = None, prior = None, normalize = False, return_norm_constant = False)

      Implements back projection :math:`H^T g` on an image :math:`g`.

      :param image: image which is to be back projected
      :type image: torch.tensor[batch_size, Ltheta, Lr, Lz]
      :param angle_subset: Only uses a subset of angles (i.e. only certain values of :math:`j` in formula above) when back projecting. Useful for ordered-subset reconstructions. Defaults to None, which assumes all angles are used.
      :type angle_subset: list, optional
      :param prior: If included, modifes normalizing factor to :math:`\frac{1}{\sum_j H_{ij} + P_i}` where :math:`P_i` is given by the prior. Used, for example, during in MAP OSEM. Defaults to None.
      :type prior: Prior, optional
      :param normalize: Whether or not to divide result by :math:`\sum_j H_{ij}`
      :type normalize: bool
      :param return_norm_constant: Whether or not to return :math:`1/\sum_j H_{ij}` along with back projection. Defaults to 'False'.

      Implements back projection :math:`U^T H^T g` on an image :math:`g`, returning a vector of activities for each mask region.

              Args:
