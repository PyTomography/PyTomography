.. py:function:: get_prob_of_detection_matrix(attenuation_map, dx)

   Converts an attenuation map of :math:`\text{cm}^{-1}` to a probability of photon detection matrix (scanner at +x). Note that this requires the attenuation map to be at the energy of photons being emitted.

   :param attenuation_map: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to the attenuation coefficient in :math:`{\text{cm}^{-1}}
   :type attenuation_map: torch.tensor
   :param dx: Axial plane pixel spacing.
   :type dx: float

   :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to probability of photon being detected at detector at +x axis.
   :rtype: torch.tensor


.. py:class:: SPECTAttenuationTransform(attenuation_map = None, filepath = None, mode = 'constant', assume_padded = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of attenuation in SPECT. This transform accepts either an ``attenuation_map`` (which must be aligned with the SPECT projection data) or a ``filepath`` consisting of folder containing CT DICOM files all pertaining to the same scan

   :param attenuation_map: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] corresponding to the attenuation coefficient in :math:`{\text{cm}^{-1}}` at the photon energy corresponding to the particular scan
   :type attenuation_map: torch.tensor
   :param filepath: Folder location of CT scan; all .dcm files must correspond to different slices of the same scan.
   :type filepath: Sequence[str]
   :param mode: Mode used for extrapolation of CT beyond edges when aligning DICOM SPECT/CT data. Defaults to `'constant'`, which means the image is padded with zeros.
   :type mode: str
   :param assume_padded: Assumes objects and projections fed into forward and backward methods are padded, as they will be in reconstruction algorithms
   :type assume_padded: bool

   .. py:method:: configure(object_meta, proj_meta)

      Function used to initalize the transform using corresponding object and projection metadata

      :param object_meta: Object metadata.
      :type object_meta: SPECTObjectMeta
      :param proj_meta: Projection metadata.
      :type proj_meta: SPECTProjMeta


   .. py:method:: forward(object_i, ang_idx)

      Forward projection :math:`A:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` of attenuation correction.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.
      :type ang_idx: torch.Tensor

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: backward(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Back projection :math:`A^T:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` of attenuation correction. Since the matrix is diagonal, the implementation is the same as forward projection. The only difference is the optional normalization parameter.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along ``axis=1``.
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.
      :type ang_idx: torch.Tensor
      :param norm_constant: A tensor used to normalize the output during back projection. Defaults to None.
      :type norm_constant: torch.tensor, optional

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to an attenuation corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor
