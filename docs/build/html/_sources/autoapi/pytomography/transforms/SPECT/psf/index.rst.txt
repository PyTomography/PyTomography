.. py:class:: GaussianBlurNet(layer_r, layer_z = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`

   Network used to apply Gaussian blurring to each plane parallel to the detector head. The typical network used for low/medium energy SPECT PSF modeling.

   :param layer_r: Kernel used for blurring in radial direction
   :type layer_r: nn.Conv1d
   :param layer_z: Kernel used for blurring in sup/inf direction.
   :type layer_z: nn.Conv1d | None

   .. py:method:: forward(input)

      Applies PSF blurring to `input`. Each X-plane gets a different blurring kernel applied, depending on detector distance.

      :param input: Object to apply Gaussian blurring to
      :type input: torch.tensor

      :returns: Blurred object, adjusted such that subsequent summation along the x-axis models the CDR
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:class:: ArbitraryPSFNet(kernel_f, distances, kernel_size, dr)

   Bases: :py:obj:`torch.nn.Module`

   Network used to apply an arbitrary PSF based on the `kernel_f` function, which should be a function of parallel directions :math:`x` and :math:`y` and perpendicular direction :math:`d` to the detector head

   :param kernel_f: PSF kernel
   :type kernel_f: Callable
   :param distances: Distances corresponding to each plane parallel to the detector
   :type distances: Sequence[float]
   :param kernel_size: Size of kernel used for blurring. Should be large enough to encapsulate the entire PSF at all distances
   :type kernel_size: int
   :param dr: The :math:`x` and :math:`y` voxel spacing in the object
   :type dr: Sequence[float]

   .. py:method:: forward(input)

      Applies PSF blurring to `input`. Each X-plane gets a different blurring kernel applied, depending on detector distance.

      :param input: Object to apply blurring to
      :type input: torch.tensor

      :returns: Blurred object, adjusted such that subsequent summation along the x-axis models the CDR
      :rtype: torch.tensor



.. py:function:: get_1D_PSF_layer(sigmas, kernel_size)

   Creates a 1D convolutional layer that is used for PSF modeling.

   :param sigmas: Array of length Lx corresponding to blurring (sigma of Gaussian) as a function of distance from scanner
   :type sigmas: array
   :param kernel_size: Size of the kernel used in each layer. Needs to be large enough to cover most of Gaussian
   :type kernel_size: int

   :returns: Convolutional neural network layer used to apply blurring to objects of shape [Lx, L1, L2] where Lx is treated as a batch size, L1 as the channel (or group index) and L2 is the axis being blurred over
   :rtype: torch.nn.Conv2d


.. py:class:: SPECTPSFTransform(psf_meta = None, kernel_f = None, psf_net = None, assume_padded = True)

   Bases: :py:obj:`pytomography.transforms.Transform`

   obj2obj transform used to model the effects of PSF blurring in SPECT. The smoothing kernel used to apply PSF modeling uses a Gaussian kernel with width :math:`\sigma` dependent on the distance of the point to the detector; that information is specified in the ``SPECTPSFMeta`` parameter. There are a few potential arguments to initialize this transform (i) `psf_meta`, which contains relevant collimator information to obtain a Gaussian PSF model that works for low/medium energy SPECT (ii) `kernel_f`, an callable function that gives the kernel at any source-detector distance :math:`d`, or (iii) `psf_net`, a network configured to automatically apply full PSF modeling to a given object :math:`f` at all source-detector distances. Only one of the arguments should be given.

   :param psf_meta: Metadata corresponding to the parameters of PSF blurring. In most cases (low/medium energy SPECT), this should be the only given argument.
   :type psf_meta: SPECTPSFMeta
   :param kernel_f: Function :math:`PSF(x,y,d)` that gives PSF at every source-detector distance :math:`d`. It should be able to take in 1D numpy arrays as its first two arguments, and a single argument for the final argument :math:`d`. The function should return a corresponding 2D PSF kernel.
   :type kernel_f: Callable
   :param psf_net: Network that takes in an object :math:`f` and applies all necessary PSF correction to return a new object :math:`\tilde{f}` that is PSF corrected, such that subsequent summation along the x-axis accurately models the collimator detector response.
   :type psf_net: Callable

   .. py:method:: _compute_kernel_size(radius, axis)

      Function used to compute the kernel size used for PSF blurring. In particular, uses the ``min_sigmas`` attribute of ``SPECTPSFMeta`` to determine what the kernel size should be such that the kernel encompasses at least ``min_sigmas`` at all points in the object.

      :returns: The corresponding kernel size used for PSF blurring.
      :rtype: int

      Applies the PSF transform :math:`A:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis.

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to n PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor


   .. py:method:: backward(object_i, ang_idx, norm_constant = None)

      Applies the transpose of the PSF transform :math:`A^T:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{U}` for the situation where an object is being detector by a detector at the :math:`+x` axis. Since the PSF transform is a symmetric matrix, its implemtation is the same as the ``forward`` method.

      :param object_i: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] being projected along its first axis
      :type object_i: torch.tensor
      :param ang_idx: The projection indices: used to find the corresponding angle in projection space corresponding to each projection angle in ``object_i``.

      :returns: Tensor of size [batch_size, Lx, Ly, Lz] such that projection of this tensor along the first axis corresponds to n PSF corrected projection.
      :rtype: torch.tensor
