A system matrix consists of sequences of object&#45;to&#45;object and image&#45;to&#45;image transforms that model various characteristics of the imaging system, such as attenuation and blurring. While the class implements the operator :math:`H:\mathbb{U} \to \mathbb{V}` through the ``forward`` method, it also implements :math:`H^T:\mathbb{V} \to \mathbb{U}` through the `backward` method, required during iterative reconstruction algorithms such as OSEM." alt="" coords="5,5,116,31"/>
